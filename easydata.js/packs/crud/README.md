# @easydata/crud (part of EasyData library)

## What is EasyData?

EasyData is an open-source library that allows you to simplify data management tasks in your web applications. Here we are talking about usual CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations first of all.

EasyData introduces a declarative approach to building a user interface for most data operations. 
You simply describe your data: entities (tables), attributes (fields), relationships between them, data types, constraints, etc., and EasyData automatically, at run-time renders the necessary forms and dialogs to view, search and edit the data.

## What is @easydata/crud package?

This package is a part EasyData.JS library. 
It contains UI widgets and views for implementing UI for CRUD (create/read/update/delete) operations over your database.

## How to start?

@easydata NPM packages make up the client-side part of EasyData. It means that you need something on your server-side to utilize EasyData in your project. The possible options are:

### 1. ASP.NET Core projects

To start with ASP.NET Core backend you can simply clone [EasyData repository on GitHub](https://github.com/KorzhCom/EasyData/) and try one of the sample projects included in that repository. After that, you can follow [the instruction](https://github.com/KorzhCom/EasyData/blob/master/README.md) published there to apply EasyData to your own project.

### 2. Any other backend platform.

Sorry, but it's not possible yet :(

Please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/KorzhCom/EasyData/issues) (or vote for an existing one) to encourage us to add the support for your platform of choice faster.
